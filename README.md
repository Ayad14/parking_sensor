parking_sensor
==============

A repository for the parking sensors codebase.

-The DHT_Attiny85 code is for programming an Attiny85 w/ an example DHT 11 humidity/temp sensor

-The ParkingProject codebase is the currently running code on my dev arduino.  
Two pressure sensors with pressurized tubes are attached 1 ea to ea sensor.  This data is transmitted via an xbee pro.

Currently the sensing and transmissions works, up to about 400 feet.  The ParkingProject code is hardly intelligent.

-traffic_counter_software_v5 is a code base pulled from an opensource project off the web http://tomorrow-lab.com
It's being modifed to run our particular setup.
